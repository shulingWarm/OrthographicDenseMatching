# OrthographicDenseMatching

This is the program and runtime libraries of the unpublished article, A Novel Method for Digital Orthophoto Generation from Top-view Constrained Dense Matching.

The program for testing is available at
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w-HCJHIKYzcsW8LWFd-arfIlHVT7wwix?usp=sharing.

To test the function of our method, run the bash file DOMGenerate.sh on a Linux system.

The input file should be the SfM_Data file of openMVG.
