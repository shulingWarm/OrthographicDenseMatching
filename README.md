# OrthographicDenseMatching

This is the source code of the algorithm in the article  Novel Method for Digital Orthophoto Generation from Top View Constrained Dense Matching, which is available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366668239_A_Novel_Method_for_Digital_Orthophoto_Generation_from_Top_View_Constrained_Dense_Matching.

The program can be compiled and launched on Linux. The executable DOMGenerate is for testing the algorithm. The input file should be the output file of the executable OpenMVG_Global_SfM in the open source library OpenMVG.
